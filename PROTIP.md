Pro Tip for Mayhem 2.2.0
Since you have the Internal Speaker, go to Settings -> Audio and ensure "Speaker" is enabled. In Mayhem v2.2.0, you can also use the "Search" app to automatically scan the 144–148 MHz range; the aluminum case will help you find "clean" peaks without much noise interference.
